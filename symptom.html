                <summary>NECK AND SHOULDER PROBLEMS</summary>
                <p>
                    Neck and shoulder pain is usually the result of strains and sprains from overexertion or bad
                    posture. Sometimes this pain will go away on its own. Stretching and strengthening exercises can
                    also treat the pain. Sometimes neck and shoulder pain is due to a fracture in the bones of your
                    shoulder.

                <summary>TENSION HEADACHE</summary>
                <p>
                    Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. Stress and muscle tension are often factors
                    in these headaches. Tension headaches typically don't cause nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to
                    light. They do cause a steady ache, rather than a throbbing one, and tend to affect both sides of
                    the head.

                <summary>MIGRAINE</summary>
                <p>
                    A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one
                    side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and
                    sound. Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes
                    with your daily activities.

                <summary>MOUSE ARM</summary>
                <p>
                    Mouse arm is a collective name for pain and stiffness in the arm, neck, shoulders, back, wrist and
                    fingers. The problems are due, among other things, to locked monotonous working positions when the
                    muscles are strained on one side for a long period, for example when using a computer.

                <summary>LOW BACK PROBLEMS</summary>
                <p>
                    Lower back pain is very common. It can result from a strain (injury) to muscles or tendons in the
                    back. Other causes include arthritis, structural problems and disk injuries. Pain often gets better
                    with rest, physical therapy and medication.

                <summary>LUMBAGO</summary>
                <p>
                    Lumbago is an acute or persistent discomfort in the lower back that can afflict anyone. The causes
                    for lumbago include but are not restricted to back injury, herniated (slipped) disk, obesity, weak
                    back muscles, spasms, and tumors (both benign and malignant) in the spinal area.

                <summary>HIP PROBLEMS</summary>
                <p>
                    Pain in the hip is the experience of pain in the muscles or joints in the hip/ pelvic region, a
                    condition commonly arising from any of a number of factors. Sometimes it is closely associated with
                    lower back pain.

                <summary>SCIATICA</summary>
                <p>
                    Sciatica is pain going down the leg from the lower back. This pain may go down the back, outside,
                    or front of the leg. Onset is often sudden following activities like heavy lifting, though
                    gradual onset may also occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pain is often described as shooting. Typically, symptoms are
                    only on one side of the body. Certain causes, however, may result in pain on both sides. Lower
                    back pain is sometimes present. Weakness or numbness may occur in various parts of the affected
                    leg and foot.

                <summary>KNEE PROBLEMS</summary>
                <p>
                    Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages. Knee pain may be the result of an
                    injury, such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage. Medical conditions — including arthritis,
                    gout and infections — also can cause knee pain.

                <summary>SPORTS INJURIES</summary>
                <p>
                    Sports injuries are divided into two broad categories, acute and chronic injuries. Acute injuries
                    happen suddenly, such as when a person falls, receives a blow, or twists a joint, while chronic
                    injuries usually result from overuse of one area of the body and develop gradually over time.

                <summary>HAMSTRING PROBLEMS</summary>
                <p>
                    Mild hamstring strains (grade 1) will usually cause sudden pain and tenderness at the back of your
                    thigh. It may be painful to move your leg, but the strength of the muscle should not be affected.
                    Partial hamstring tears (grade 2) are usually more painful and tender.
