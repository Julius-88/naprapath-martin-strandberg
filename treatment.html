                <summary>NAPRAPATHI</summary>
                <p>
                    The naprapath examines, prevents, diagnoses, treats, and rehabilitates and prevents pain conditions
                    and impaired function in all parts of the locomotor organs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A naprapat always starts from the whole
                    and takes into account physical as well as psychological and social factors that can contribute to
                    the occurrence of pain and other problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A naprapath is an expert in manual medicine and uses his
                    hands in the various treatment techniques. Manipulation and mobilization aimed at restoring function
                    in joints is combined with massage, connective tissue techniques and stretching aimed at the soft
                    parts of the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The treatment lasts about 40 min. The cost is SEK 600.

                <summary>DRY NEEDLING</summary>
                <p>
                    Dry Needling is an effective treatment option for treating muscular problems and pain.
                    I often use this treatment together with treatment of the joints of the spine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dry Needling is not acupuncture. What is similar is that we use the same type of needles. It is
                    normal for the needles to be 0.3-0.40 mm thick. The needles are sterile disposable needles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of Dry Needling is to change the tense muscle string that is the cause of the patient's
                    discomfort and/or pain.
                </p>
                <h4>DOES IT HURT?</h4>
                <p>
                    When the needle is inserted into the skin, it may sting a little, but usually you don't feel it at
                    all. When the needle hits a trigger point, this will produce a so-called local twitch response. The
                    muscle then twitches, which can cause a short pain, which some describe as electric and some as a
                    cramp. This is completely normal and that is what I want to achieve with the treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should expect to be sore after the treatment, as if you have worked the muscle very hard. This
                    is mostly after the first treatment and this reaction then subsides with subsequent treatments.
                </p>

                <summary>MASSAGE</summary>
                <p>
                    Massage is a natural part of a naprapat treatment, but at Naprapat Martin Strandberg, classic
                    Swedish massage is also offered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The massage softens tense muscles and causes your blood flow to increase, which also increases your
                    performance. You get deeper and calmer breathing, which counteracts tension in pain conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By treating yourself to a massage regularly, you can counteract stress and long-term fatigue and
                    prevent problems in muscles and joints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the treatment, you can tell us what you want to get out of today's massage. It could be that
                    you have a specific problem or that you want to relax and slow down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The treatment lasts 30 minutes or 60 minutes. The cost is SEK 400 and SEK 600 respectively
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>SPORTS MASSAGE</summary>
                <p>
                    Sports massage is a good complement to training and competition. The treatment helps the muscles to
                    recover faster after a hard training session, so that training effect and performance are increased.
                    The massage can also prevent muscular injuries, shorten healing processes and works well as a
                    recharge before competitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always adapt the massage to your specific needs, regardless of whether you are an athlete or not.
                    A deep massage reduces pain and dissolves tension in the entire body that can arise from, for
                    example, stress. In addition, it helps you feel calmer and more relaxed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sports massage is often more powerful than a regular massage. With powerful grips and stretches, I
                    soften the muscles that cause problems. Stretching and trigger point treatment are also often added
                    for best results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The treatment lasts 30 minutes or 60 minutes. The cost is SEK 400 and SEK 600 respectively.
                </p>

                <summary>ORTHOPEDIC INSOLES</summary>
                <p>
                    Over 75% of the population suffers from misalignment such as overpronation or excessive supination
                    without us even realizing it. The effects can be felt throughout the body, whether in muscle and
                    joint pain but also strain injuries in the feet, knees, hips and back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All feet are different and often our feet differ from right to left. At Naprapat Martin Strandberg,
                    you get a complete foot analysis and individually adapted insoles. Each FootBalance sole is
                    individually adapted to each foot, which enables perfect fit and support regardless of the type of
                    clubfoot, foot shape or differences between right and left feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The soles are dynamic and allow the foot's natural pronation and thus prevent and strengthen the
                    foot's musculature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, they increase the comfort of your shoes while helping you lead a more active life and a
                    more balanced posture.
                    The process takes less than ten minutes and you can start using your insoles right away!
